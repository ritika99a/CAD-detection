 ## About The Project

This project focuses on developing an efficient machine learning-based diagnostic tool for Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) using an ensemble of classifiers. By employing rigorous preprocessing, including data cleaning and label encoding, and utilizing the SelectKBest feature selection algorithm, the study identified the most relevant attributes for accurate CAD prediction. Various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree were evaluated, with the ensemble framework demonstrating superior performance. The model achieved high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores, indicating its potential for non-invasive, cost-effective, and rapid CAD diagnosis. The findings highlight the transformative potential of machine learning in enhancing early detection and treatment of cardiovascular diseases, contributing to improved patient care and resource optimization in healthcare.
